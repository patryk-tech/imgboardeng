Imageboard engine developed by me, using Django. For the front end I used jQuery.
There is a 5 page limit with 10 posts on each page, after that limit is reached, should someone create a new thread, the last one is deleted. 
Here's how it looks:

When you post each post there is a password (automatically generated at first but users can change it) which is responsible for letting someone delete their posts or sign reply inside a thread as an original poster. There is also a sign for moderators. 
If you are a moderator you can sign your posts with moderator sign.
You can also report posts (multiple at once too), and there is a moderator panel.
